This document summarizes survey efforts and results for forest bird monitoring during the two years in which we performed field surveys, 2021 and 2022.

In collaboration with the Appalachian Mountains Joint Venture (AMJV), we implemented a monitoring program using paired point counts and autonomous recording units (ARUs) to establish baseline data for breeding season habitat use by target species Wood Thrush (WOTH, *Hylocichla mustelina*), Cerulean Warbler (CERW, *Setophaga cerulea*), and Golden-winged Warbler (GWWA, *Vermivora chrysoptera*) within Dynamic Forest Restoration Blocks, and to track avian response to forest management activities.

Avian monitoring surveys ran from `r filter(visits, year == 2021)$date |> min() |>  format('%d %b')` to `r filter(visits, year == 2021)$date |> max() |>  format('%d %b')` 2021 and `r filter(visits, year == 2022)$date |> min() |>  format('%d %b')` to `r filter(visits, year == 2022)$date |> max() |>  format('%d %b')` 2022, coinciding with the early breeding season for songbirds in the central Appalachian region. Fixed-radius point counts were conducted at each location twice per season beginning 30 minutes before sunrise and concluding four hours after sunrise.

The Dynamic Forest Restoration Blocks surveyed consisted of T. M. Gathright Wildlife Management Area in Bath County; Goshen and Little North Mountain Wildlife Management Area in Rockbridge County; portions of the George Washington & Jefferson National Forests; and lands held by The Nature Conservancy (NGO) and private landowners. Sampling units were classified as either "effects monitoring" (units slated to receive some type of forest management, such as prescribed burns or timber harvest), or "population monitoring" (units with no imminent management planned). Size and observer capacity prohibited surveying the entirety of each sampling unit; therefore, we worked with the AMJV to develop a sampling methodology to best capture bird community response to forest management over time, which we discussed with the VA project team at the region-wide monitoring planning meeting. 

# Monitoring Effort

## ARU Deployments

We deployed automated recording units (ARUs) during both field seasons. In 2021, we successfully retrieved `r annual_arupoints[1, 2]` units; each unit was deployed for `r round(deployment_time[[1, 2]], 1)` days on average, generating a total of 3.5 TB of audio data. In 2022, we retrieved ARUs from `r annual_arupoints[2, 2]` points after an average deployment of `r round(deployment_time[[2, 2]], 1)` days, resulting in 917.9 GB of data. These data are banked for future analysis at UMCES and the Kitzes Lab.

In 2021, we had high rates of ARU loss due to animals, presumably black bears, destroying or removing units (Figure \@ref(fig:aruphoto)). Twenty-one percent of all deployed units showed some evidence of animal damage. Bears seemed to be attracted to excessive flagging tape and obvious placement of the ARUs. We remedied this in 2022 by attaching units higher off the ground, concealing them with lightweight camouflage cloth, and using minimal flagging on a nearby tree. These changes successfully reduced ARU damage in 2022, with only four units showing evidence of damage (primarily bitten bags) and one unit lost. Several other units were damaged by water or failed to record for the full deployment period, though a portion of these still collected audio data.

```{r aruphoto, fig.cap="Left: Flagging tape on a 2021 ARU deployment. Center: Typical bear damage to 2021 ARUs. Right: Improved concealment of ARU deployed in 2022.", fig.show = "hold", out.width = "30%"}

knitr::include_graphics("Goshen10_ARU_MM_crop.jpg")
knitr::include_graphics("BearDamage_MM_crop.jpg")
knitr::include_graphics("burn_area_aru.jpg")
```

Distribution of ARUs by ownership type was mostly consistent between years, with the exception of federal ownership (Figure \@ref(fig:aruownership)). At federally owned plots, we deployed 84 ARUs in 2021 and 16 in 2022. Most of the 2021 deployments were at Potts, which we did not cover in 2022.

```


## Point Count Surveys

In 2021 we conducted `r count(filter(visits, year == 2021))` surveys at `r length(unique(filter(visits, year == 2021)$point_id))` total points, of which `r filter(n_visits, year == 2021, visits == 2)[[1, 3]]` were visited twice and `r filter(n_visits, year == 2021, visits == 1)[[1, 3]]` were visited only once. 
In 2022 we again conducted `r count(filter(visits, year == 2022))` surveys but at `r length(unique(filter(visits, year == 2022)$point_id))` points, with more even coverage; all but one point was visited twice. In 2021, visits to a point were separated by `r filter(visit_interval, year == 2021)[[1, 2]]` days on average, while in 2022 we condensed the field season so visits were separated by `r filter(visit_interval, year == 2022)[[1, 2]]` days on average. Surveys were conducted by four trained observers (Table \@ref(tab:observers)). In 2022, Frostburg State University undergraduate interns A'Laurenye' McBeth and Atlee Wise assisted with field work; Atlee Wise performed several point counts after shadowing and practicing alongside our main observers. 

```{r observers}
visits |>  
  summarize(
    surveys = n(), 
    .by = c(observer, year)) |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = surveys) |>

    col.names = c('Observer', '2021', '2022'),
    caption = 'Number of point count surveys performed by each observer by year.') |> 
kableExtra::kable_styling('striped', full_width = F, fixed_thead = T)
```

The number of ARUs and point count locations was not always the same within a sampling unit (Table \@ref(tab:focalarus)). In 2022, three sampling units were dropped due to lack of time: Fed B, Bolar Mountain, and Potts. However, we added an additional 22 effects monitoring points at Goshen WMA, many of which were in a recently burned area and will provide information on the avian community post-prescribed fire at this location.

# Species Detections

Between both years, we observed `r length(unique(untidy_data$species))` bird species during point count surveys. The most abundant species were Red-eyed Vireo (*Vireo olivaceus*), Ovenbird (*Seiurus aurocapilla*), and Scarlet Tanager (*Piranga olivacea*), Figure \@ref(fig:topspecies). We observed a slightly lower abundance of Wood Thrush in 2022 compared to 2021. Complete species lists for each sampling unit can be found in [Appendix I].

We detected two of the three focal species during point count surveys: Wood Thrush and Cerulean Warbler (Table \@ref(tab:focaloccu)). No Golden-winged Warblers or *Vermivora* hybrids were detected during surveys, although one *Vermivora* sp. was heard outside of the count period at TNC Warm Springs Mountain Preserve in 2022 (NGO F). Wood Thrush was detected in nearly all plots, but Cerulean Warbler was restricted to three units: Fed C, in the George Washington & Jefferson National Forest near California, VA; NGO A, on the TNC property at Hobby Horse Farm Road south of Healing Springs; and State D, a slope near Lake Moomaw at T. M. Gathright WMA. A preview of point count data can be explored in [Appendix II].

# Vegetation surveys

We performed basic vegetation surveys at ARU deployment locations, which are intended to provide information on fine-scale habitat characteristics that may influence sound quality of the recordings. At each location, we measured the DBH of the tree to which the ARU was attached, the basal area of the surroundings (taken while standing at the ARU tree), the compass direction that the ARU faced, the angle of the slope in the direction the ARU faced, and a count of the number of small (<5 cm in diameter) and large (5-10 cm in diameter) shrubs and trees along a 5-meter transect extending in the direction the ARU faced. Figure \@ref(fig:veg2) shows the distributions of these vegetation values.

We conducted two successful seasons of point count surveys and deployed ARUs across multiple land ownership types in the AMJV Dynamic Forest Restoration Blocks. Throughout the process, we worked closely with partners from the American Bird Conservancy, Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources, The Nature Conservancy, and beyond to prioritize survey locations and coordinate site access. Consequently, we surveyed a number of remote areas; we hope this will
provide a fuller picture of the forest bird community than if we had limited our efforts to easily accessible locations. The success of this fieldwork was due in no small part to the positive working relationship of the various federal, state, private, university, and NGO partners who are committed to monitoring and managing forest bird populations in Appalachia.

In addition, we were able to provide valuable training in field data collection and data entry to two undergraduate interns from Frostburg State University. This allowed them to explore their interests and develop relevant skills for their future careers.

To date, we have downloaded and transferred all ARU data to collaborators at the University of Pittsburgh. Members of Justin Kitzes’ lab are currently developing machine learning algorithms to classify avian vocalizations from the ARU recordings. In the future, we imagine they will be able to validate their species identification and distance algorithms using the data collected during point count surveys by human observers.

For the three AMJV focal bird species, we collected additional information during point count surveys on the distance at which the individual was first detected and the minute(s) in which it was observed vocalizing. Our next steps with these data will be to model how landscape metrics and stand composition impact focal species. This will most likely take the form of occupancy models for Wood Thrush, though the data we collected is suitable for additional types of modeling as well.

A list of all data provided alongside this report is available in [Appendix III].
