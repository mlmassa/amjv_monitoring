This document summarizes survey efforts and results for forest bird monitoring during the `r report_year` field season.

In collaboration with the Appalachian Mountains Joint Venture (AMJV), we implemented a monitoring program using paired point counts and autonomous recording units (ARUs) to establish baseline data for habitat use by target species Wood Thrush (WOTH, *Hylocichla mustelina*), Cerulean Warbler (CERW, *Setophaga cerulea*), and Golden-winged Warblers (GWWA, *Vermivora chrysoptera*) within Dynamic Forest Restoration Blocks, and to track avian response to forest management activities.

Monitoring surveys ran from `r filter(visits, year(date) == report_year)$date %>% min() %>% format('%d %b')` to `r filter(visits, year(date) == report_year)$date %>% max() %>% format('%d %b')` `r report_year`, coinciding with the early breeding season for songbirds in the central Appalachian region. Point counts were conducted at each location twice per season beginning 30 minutes before sunrise and concluding four hours after sunrise. 

The Dynamic Forest Restoration Blocks surveyed consisted of T. M. Gathright Wildlife Management Area in Bath County; Goshen and Little North Mountain Wildlife Management Area in Rockbridge County; portions of the George Washington & Jefferson National Forests; and NGO and private lands. Sampling units were classified as either effects or population monitoring. Size and observer capacity prohibited surveying the entirety of each sampling unit; therefore, we worked with the AMJV to develop a sampling methodology to best capture bird community response to forest management over time, working with the VA project team and discussed at the region-wide monitoring planning meeting. 

# Monitoring effort

In `r report_year` we conducted `r count(filter(visits, year(date) == report_year))` surveys at `r length(unique(filter(visits, year(date) == report_year)$point_id))` total points, of which `r n_visits[[2, 2]]` `r if_else(n_visits[[2, 2]] == 1, 'point was', 'points were')` visited twice and `r n_visits[[1, 2]]` `r if_else(n_visits[[1, 2]] == 1, 'point was', 'points were')` visited only once. We deployed ARUs at `r unique(filter(audiomoth_activity, year(date) == report_year, !is.na(point_id))$point_id) %>% length()` points. Counts were separated by an average of `r visits %>% filter(year(date) == report_year) %>% select(point_id, visit, date) %>% pivot_wider(names_from = visit, values_from = date, names_prefix = 'date_') %>% mutate(interval = date_2 - date_1) %>% pull(interval) %>% mean(na.rm = T) %>% floor() %>% as.numeric()` days. This year, undergraduate interns A'Laurenye' McBeth and Atlee Wise assisted with field work; Atlee Wise performed several point counts after shadowing and practicing alongside our main observers.

```{r observers}
visits %>% 
  group_by(observer, year = year(date)) %>% 
  summarize(surveys = n()) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = surveys) %>% 
  mutate_all(~replace(., is.na(.), 0)) %>% 
  kable(col.names = c('Observer', '2021', '2022'),
        caption = 'Table 1. Number of point count surveys performed by each observer by year.') %>% 
kableExtra::kable_styling('striped', full_width = F, fixed_thead = T)
```

```{r annual_mismatch}
annual_mismatch <- 
  visits %>% 
  group_by(point_id, year = year(date)) %>%
  summarize(visits = max(visit)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = visits, names_prefix = 'y')

```

Compared to the previous year, we sampled at `r abs(length((filter(annual_mismatch, !is.na(y2021)))$point_id) - length((filter(annual_mismatch, !is.na(y2022)))$point_id))` fewer points in total, but added `r length(unique(filter(filter(visits, year(date) == report_year - 1), point_id %in% (filter(visits, year(date) == report_year - 1)$point_id))))` points not sampled in `r report_year - 1`. Missed points were primarily at Potts (12) Fed B (6), and Bolar Mountain Effects (5) plots, which were not sampled this year. Gains were primarily due to adding additional 11 new Goshen Effects points opportunistically. In total there were `r filter(annual_mismatch, y2021 == 2 & y2022 == 2) %>% nrow()` points that were surveyed twice per season in both years (representing full data coverage).

Point counts detected two focal species, Wood Thrush and Cerulean Warbler. No Golden-winged Warblers or *Vermivora* hybrids were detected, though one was observed outside the sampling period at a TNC sampling plot on Warm Springs Mountain that was burned in 2022. Total detections of focal species can be found in Table 1. While Wood Thrush was detected in nearly all plots, Cerulean Warbler was uncommonly detected.

We observed `r length(unique(filter(untidy_data, year(date) == report_year)$species))` species in total. The mean number of species observed per plot was `r round(mean(summary_plots$Species), 1)` (SD = `r round(sd(summary_plots$Species), 2)`). The most abundant species were Red-eyed Vireo (*Vireo olivaceus*), Ovenbird (*Seiurus aurocapilla*), and Scarlet Tanager (*Piranga olivacea*). Complete species lists for each plot can be found in Appendix I.

We successfully reduced ARU damage this year, with only one unit lost to bears. A combination of factors likely contributed to this success, including lower reported numbers of black bears in the area, only using silica packets in a subset of ARUs, covering ARUs with camo cloth (see image), and attempting to place ARUs away from active bear trails.

# Maps

The following maps show the number of species and the individuals of each focal species observed at each point. Colored blocks represent the sampling units colored by ownership type. You can zoom, pan, and switch between topographic and satellite base layers in the layer panel on the left. To view focal species layers individually, click to expand the layer panel on the left and then check or uncheck the species. Mouse over a point to see its name. Click on a point or sampling unit to see information about it including ownership, focal species, ARU information, etc.

# Conclusion

We had a successful second season of monitoring in Bath and Rockbridge County, Virginia with paired point count surveys and ARU sampling on federal, state, NGO and private lands. We largely replicated the 2021 effort. Some locations visited in 2021 were not revisited and new locations were added. ARU recovery rate was much higher in 2022. Our more condensed sampling period was successful and we encountered similar abundances of most species.
