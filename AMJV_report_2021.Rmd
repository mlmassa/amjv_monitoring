In collaboration with the Appalachian Mountains Joint Venture (AMJV), we designed and implemented a monitoring program using paired point counts and autonomous recording units (ARUs) to establish baseline data for habitat use by target species Wood Thrush (WOTH, *Hylocichla mustelina*), Cerulean Warbler (CERW, *Setophaga cerulea*), and Golden-winged Warblers (GWWA, *Vermivora chrysoptera*) within Dynamic Forest Restoration Blocks, and to track avian response to forest management activities.

Monitoring surveys occurred during May and June of 2021, coinciding with the peak breeding season for songbirds in the central Appalachian region. Point counts were conducted at each location twice per season beginning 30 minutes before sunrise and concluding four hours after sunrise. 

The Dynamic Forest Restoration Blocks surveyed consisted of T. M. Gathright Wildlife Management Area in Bath County; Goshen and Little North Mountain Wildlife Management Area in Rockbridge County; portions of the George Washington & Jefferson National Forests; and NGO and private lands. Sampling units were classified as either effects or population monitoring. Size and observer capacity prohibited surveying the entirety of each sampling unit; therefore, we worked with the AMJV to develop a sampling methodology to best capture bird community response to forest management over time, working with the VA project team and discussed at the region-wide monitoring planning meeting. 

We designed a tidy database and generated this report summarizing our efforts during the 2021 field season. 

```{r data_import, include = FALSE}
# Import data
read_rds('data/raw/amjv_data.rds') %>% 
  list2env(.GlobalEnv)

# Create untidy dataset
untidy_data <-
  count_data %>% 
    left_join(visits) %>% 
    left_join(points) %>% 
    left_join(plots)
```

### Monitoring effort

We conducted `r count(visits)` surveys at `r length(unique(visits$point_id))` total points during two sampling periods. The two rounds were separated by 2-3 weeks at 91 of these points; 27 points were only visited once due to time constraints or other issues. We deployed ARUs at `r length(unique(audiomoth_activity$point_id))` total points, collecting 3.18 TB of audio data, which has been downloaded but has not been analyzed.

Point counts detected two focal species, Wood Thrush and Cerulean Warbler. No Golden-winged Warblers or *Vermivora* hybrids were detected. Total detections of focal species can be found in Table 1. While Wood Thrush was detected in nearly all plots, Cerulean Warbler was only detected in two plots: Fed C, in the George Washington & Jefferson National Forest near California, VA; and State D, a slope near the lake at T. M. Gathright WMA.

We observed `r length(unique(untidy_data$species))` species in total. The mean number of species observed per plot was `r mean(summary_plots$species)` (SD = `r round(sd(summary_plots$species), 3)`). The most abundant species were Red-eyed Vireo (*Vireo olivaceus*), Ovenbird (*Seiurus aurocapilla*), Scarlet Tanager (*Piranga olivacea*), Tufted Titmouse (*Baeolophus bicolor*), and Worm-eating Warbler (*Helmitheros vermivorum*). Complete species lists for each plot can be found in Appendix I.

Some species were only detected in the first round of sampling. Species that were observed more than once during the first sampling period but not observed in the second: Wild Turkey (*Meleagris gallopavo*), Red-winged Blackbird (*Agelaius phoeniceus*), Swainson's Thrush (*Catharus ustulatus*), and Yellow-throated Warbler (*Setophaga dominica*). The only species that was observed more than once during the second sampling period but was missing in the first was Brown Creeper (*Certhia americana*). The proportion of sampled points where the species was present is shown for the 15 most abundant species in Figure 1. Interestingly, White-breasted Nuthatch (*Sitta carolinensis*) was observed on a higher proportion of counts during the second sampling period, whereas Eastern Wood-Pewee (*Contopus virens*) was observed on drastically fewer counts in the second period.

Some ARUs were lost, destroyed, damaged by water, or failed to record properly. The greatest source of data loss was from black bears. Bears were the assumed culprits of ARUs that were damaged or lost from 38 points on 13 plots (Boiling Springs, Fed B, Fed C, Fed Over, Goshen Effects, Meadowgrounds, NGO B, NGO C, Potts, State A, State B, State Over, and at TNC Effects monitoring). This means that bears interfered with 21% of all ARUs deployed. In the 2022 field season we will employ strategies such as covering bags with camo cloth, attaching them slightly higher, and potentially changing how we use silica packets, which we suspect had a scent that attracted bears.

### Maps

The following maps show the number of species and the individuals of each focal species observed at each point. Colored blocks represent the sampling units colored by ownership type. You can zoom, pan, and switch between topographic and satellite base layers in the layer panel on the left. To view focal species layers individually, click to expand the layer panel on the left and then check or uncheck the species. Mouse over a point to see its name. Click on a point or sampling unit to see information about it including ownership, focal species, ARU information, etc.

### Conclusion

We had a successful first season of monitoring in Bath and Rockbridge County, Virginia with paired point count surveys and ARU sampling on federal, state, NGO and private lands. We established the sampling locations and gained an understanding of the effort necessary to sample across this mountainous region. The sampled plots varied in the number of species detected and in the species the composition. Of the three focal species, Wood Thrush were relatively abundant among the sampling plots while Cerulean warblers were only detected on one plot and no Golden-winged Warblers or *Vermivora* hybrids were detected. With a few exceptions, more species were detected during the first round of surveys, in late May, as compared to the second round of surveys, in early to mid-June.  We did have significant loss of ARUs due to bear damage which was not surprising in this region where bear abundance is quite high. Nevertheless, we collected a considerable amount of ARU data, all of which has been downloaded from the devices and is stored and backed up on Appalachian Laboratory servers until focal species detection algorithms become available.

For the 2022 field season, we plan to largely replicate the 2021 effort. Our hope is to visit most of the same locations for paired point counts and ARU recording. The exception to this is that we do not plan to revisit Potts and sampling on a few of the Forest Service plots is dependent on the availability of the local contractor. We would like to explore options for reducing bear damage including perhaps adding a camouflage cloth covering and/or not using the silica gel packs. We also hope to implement a more consistent and meaningful vegetation survey for ARU detection, which was extremely limited in 2021 due to our time and personnel limits. Given the species detection results, we plan to conduct the counts slightly earlier and within a more condensed time period, 15 May and 10 June.
